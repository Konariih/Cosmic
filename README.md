### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/Konariih/Cosmic.git`


Cosmic was and continues to be by **Raizer**. All credits go towards him.
This fork was from 3 weeks before he deleted the Git. There is nothing custom about this, this was made so I could pull request online rankings, and they were merged before it.

Feel free to merge req If you have something. :)
